## Classify land use using Landsat satellite images
Context: 

    The main aim of this project is to classify land-use with the help of machine learning. 

Datasets: 

    In the project, there are four categories of images which are residential, forest, river and freeway. All other categories will be classified to others. The original size of the images is 256*256 pixels. Originally there are 500 images per class. But they have been divided to three datasets which called train, test and validation. There are 350 images per class in train dataset, 50 images in test dataset and 100 images in validation dataset. 

    Originally there are 21 classes but this project has selected only 4 classes. 

    This project will choose at least one image for predicting. There are three images which I can select from.
